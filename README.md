Later this will be completely written in Rust.
Currently, it is completely broken and not worth your time.
## Below are just random notes I made long ago. They are currently incomprehensible.
* Blockchains are expendable.
* Useful proof of work.
* Public key encryption is used to verify identities of people.
* Token is passed to a key that was derived using hardened derivation.
* Lockscript language is Turing complete.
* [pycryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)

## token abilities:
* revoke
* expire
* grant
* access

## Inspiration
* Bitcoin
* Etherium
* [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash)
